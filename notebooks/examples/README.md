# Example Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks with ``dysh`` examples.
We recommend reading the ``dysh`` documentation at https://dysh.readthedocs.io , which contains the same contents organized and with more context.

However, if you want to skip directly into the notebooks, start with `README.ipynb` as a top level guide
