    "Similar to a position-switched observation, two beams are selected for simultaneous observing (though the receiver can have more than two beams). In the first scan BEAM1 is looking at the source, while BEAM2 is looking at an assumed OFF position. In the next scan, BEAM2 will be looking at the source, while BEAM1 is looking at (another) OFF position. This will result in two position-switched solutions, which are then averaged for the final spectrum. \n",
