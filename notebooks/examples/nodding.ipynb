    "# Nodding Data Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows the reduction path of a nodding observation with a multi-beam receiver, the K-band Focal Plane Array (KFPA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to a position-switched observation, two beams are selected for simultaneous observing (though the receiver can have more than two beams). In the first scan BEAM1 is looking at the source, while BEAM2 is looking at an assumed OFF position. In the next scan, BEAM2 will be looking at the source, while BEAM1 is looking at (another) OFF position. This will result in two position-switched solutions, which are then averaged for the final spectrum. \n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of this observing mode is that the telescope is always ON source, bringing the noise down by $\\sqrt{2}$ compared to a classic position switched observation. Minus a small amount of slewing time of course. However, the beam separation in the receiver should be large enough to ensure that the off position is not on the source. Otherwise, a proper Position Switching observation is needed with a large enough offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the observations used in this tutorial there are also position switched observations of the same source, so we can compare the results of using beam nodding versus position switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in this tutorial were also presented in https://gbtdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-tos/data_reduction/gbtidl.html#basic-nodding in a similar GBTIDL data reduction.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral line observed here is the NH$_3$ (1,1) line at 23.69 GHz with the KFPA receiver. This receiver has 7 beams: one central beam and six beams in a roughly hexagonal pattern around the central beam. The source is a position in the W3 cloud, a roughly two degree sized Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC) with active star formation. See also https://herscheltelescope.org.uk/results/w3-star-forming-region/\n",

    "For display purposes, we use the static (non-interactive) `matplotlib` backend in this tutorial. However, you can tell `matplotlib` to use the `ipympl` backend to enable interactive plots. This is only needed if working on `jupyter` lab or notebook."
