    "# Calibration Without Noise Diodes (`calseq`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to use [`GBTFITSLoad.calseq`](https://dysh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modules/dysh.fits.html#dysh.fits.gbtfitsload.GBTFITSLoad.calseq) to derive the system temperature for observations taken with the W-Band receiver of the GBT. The W-Band receiver has two feeds (beams) and covers the frequency range from 67 to 92 GHz, and, unlike most of the GBT receivers, it does not have noise diodes for calibration. Instead it uses a wheel to put hot and cold loads in front of the receiver, in what we call a calibration sequence (calseq). For the other spectral line receiver that does not use noise, Argus, the command used to compute the system temperature is [`GBTFITSLoad.vanecal`](https://dysh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modules/dysh.fits.html#dysh.fits.gbtfitsload.GBTFITSLoad.vanecal), because Argus uses a vane instead of a wheel. An example showing how to use `vanecal` will be provided elsewhere.\n",

More details about the calibration can be found in the articles by [Kutner & Ulich (1981)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981ApJ...250..341K/abstract), [Kramer (1997)](https://publicwiki.iram.es/CalibrationPapers?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=kramer_1997_cali_rep.pdf) and [Frayer et al.
