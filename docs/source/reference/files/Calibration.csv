select,"`sdf.select( [col1]=[val1], [col2]=[val2] )`","Select subsets of the GBTFITSLoad object `sdf` based on the constraints on `col1` and `col2` given by `val1` and `val2`. See Selection explanation given ""here""."
flag,"`sdf.flag( [col1]=[val1], [col2]=[val2] )`", "Create flagging rules of the GBTFITSLoad object `sdf` based on the constraints on `col1` and `col2` given by `val1` and `val2`. See Flagging examples given here."
"gettp, [scan_num]",sdfits.gettp( scan=[scan_num] ),"Returns a Scan Block. Get a total power scan, with the option in dysh to optionally calibrate it."
"getps, [scan_num]",sdfits.getps( scan=[scan_num] ),Returns a Scan Block. Retrieve and calibrate position-switched data.
"getfs, [scan_num]",sdfits.getfs( scan=[scan_num] ),Returns a Scan Block. Retrieve and calibrate frequency-switched data.
"getnod, [scan_num]",sdfits.getnod( scan=[scan_num] ),Returns a Scan Block.
show,spec.plot(),Plot the spectrum `spec`. Calibration routines in GBTIDL do this automatically.
