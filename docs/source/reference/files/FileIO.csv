online,sdf = GBTOnline(); sdf = GBTOnline([projID]) ,Monitor the currently online project or a specific project `projID`. Load the SDFITS into `sdf`.
offline,sdf = GBTOffline([projID]),Load data from project/session `projID` into `sdf`.
"filein, [SDFITS file]",sdfits = GBTFITSLoad( [SDFITSfile] ),This will directly load a SDFITS file into python.
"dirin, [SDFITS dir]",sdfits = GBTFITSLoad( [SDFITS dir] ),"This will load each SDFITS file in a directory into python, in the case it is a project directory where each file is a different VEGAS bank. (A, B, C, etc.). The implementation is identical to the single SDFITS file load."
fileout,,"There is no direct translation; in dysh, simply specify a filename with the spectrum.write function"
keep,"spec.write( [SDFITSfile], format=[fmt] )","Write the spectrum `spec` to the output `SDFITS file` specified, using the format `fmt`"
summary,sdfits.summary(),"In dysh, you can also input a list of scan numbers you would like to see."
list,sdfits.summary( verbose=True ),"Using the ""verbose=True"" option returns similar results to GBTIDL's ""list""."
"header, scan_info",spec.meta,"Return meta information about the spectrum `spec`. In GBTIDL, this returns a text printout. In dysh, this returns a dictionary with all SDFITS keywords and values."
