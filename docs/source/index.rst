******************
``dysh`` is a Python spectral line data reduction and analysis program for singledish data with specific emphasis on data from the Green Bank Telescope.  It is currently under development in collaboration between the 
`Green Bank Observatory <https:/greenbankobservatory.org>`_ 
and the Laboratory for Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (LMA) 
at the `University of Maryland (UMD) <https://www.astro.umd.edu>`_.  
It is intended to be a full replacement for the GBO's current reduction package `GBTIDL <https://www.gb.nrao.edu/GBT/DA/gbtidl/users_guide/>`_.
