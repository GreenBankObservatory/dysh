``dysh`` Documentation
**********************

``dysh`` is a Python spectral line data reduction and analysis program for singledish data with specific emphasis on data from the Green Bank Telescope.  It is currently under development in collaboration between the
`Green Bank Observatory <https:/greenbankobservatory.org>`_
and the Laboratory for Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (LMA)
at the `University of Maryland (UMD) <https://www.astro.umd.edu>`_.
It is intended to replace `GBTIDL <https://gbtidl.nrao.edu/>`_, GBO's current spectral line data reduction package.
