Creating Documentation
======================

All Python classes and methods should be documented and the documentation must follow `the NumPy convention. <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_   Some IDEs have keyboard shortcuts to insert skeleton docstrings once the method signature is created.    Use of major features should be demonstrated in an example notebook.

Mermaid Diagrams
================

Diagrams can be directly in these text files by using the `sphinxcontrib-mermaid` package. Here's an example:

.. mermaid::

    flowchart LR
        A[Item 1] --> B[Item 2]
        B --> C[Item 3]

To learn more, see the `package documentation <https://sphinxcontrib-mermaid-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. Mermaid also offers an `online editor <https://mermaid.live>`_ which can be used to design diagrams.

Building documentation
======================

.. code::

    $ cd docs/source
    $ uv run make html

Sphinx Autobuilds
=================

Sphinx autobuilds allow live checking of local documentation.
The docs will be published at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`;  this can be modified with arguments `--host <hostname> --port <port number>`.

.. code::

    $ uv run sphinx-autobuild docs/source src/dysh/docs/build -b html

    The HTML pages are in docs/build.

Any changes in the `dysh/docs/` directory can be viewed  at the output URL, and will auto-update when changes are made. To close the server, simply `CTRL+C`.
